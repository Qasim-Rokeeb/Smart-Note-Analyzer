# Day 14 - Smart Note Analyzer 🧠

Welcome to Day 14 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey!  
Today's project is an **AI-inspired note-taking app** that classifies each note as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content.

## ✅ What I Learned

✅ How to lift and manage shared state  
✅ Simulating AI logic with keyword-based sentiment detection  
✅ Component composition (`NoteInput`, `NoteList`)  
✅ Deleting and updating data in state arrays  
✅ Toggle dark mode using state and icon switch  
✅ Using conditional classes for theming
